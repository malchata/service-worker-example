# Streaming service worker example

If you're interested in what it takes to build a Service Worker using [Navigation Preload](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/02/navigation-preload) and [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) to stream content partials from the server and assemble them with precached header and footer partials without using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox), this example repo is for you. This repo is meant to be a companion for [my article on A List Apart about faster Service Workers](https://alistapart.com/article/now-thats-what-i-call-service-worker/).

This also shows how one might use a build toolchain with a generated asset manifest (such as the one generated by [gulp-asset-manifest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-asset-manifest) in the `lib` directory). [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) is used to generate the optimized service worker in [IIFE format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE).
